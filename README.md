# text-editor-time

## Description 
A text editor app that allows the user to create notes or code snippets without an internet connection. A simple PWA that can be ran from the terminal. I have had a great difficulty getting the app to deploy. I  have made numerous changes in every file and i just could not get the app to work.

## Installation 
Simply visit my GitHub (github.com/snerowski) go to the text-editor-time repo and clone the repo to your repo and run npm i in your terminal.

## Usage 
I dont really have a usage. I simply cant get the app to work. Im going to provide screenshots of all of the changes I made and then screenshot of the heroku deployment issues. Im very sorry.
